Creative Brief:The movie I chose was 12 Years a Slave, screenplay by John Ridley. I plan to focus on and show the main character’s stages of loss he experiences throughout the story line. (contentment, confusion and chaos, denial, acceptance normalcy and finally contentment again). I will use expressive typography to show the more intense moments in the storyline such as whippings. The movie itself is such a beautiful film despite it being such a dark subject. I want i book that is also beautiful and classic. There should be contrast between the less intense scenes and the dramatic ones.  Production:typeface choose is Caslon.6”x8”, Neenah natural 30lb text paper ,perfect bind
