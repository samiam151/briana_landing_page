        solution: '<div><h3>Creative Brief: </h3><p>During my play, exploration, and collaboration of my words “mirror, intestine, and vivid” I made a couple of pretty strong connections with the words and the one that I focused on the most was the concept of “Self” and then farther down that rabbit whole- the concept of “suicide”. Self presented itself with my three words differently, “Mirror & Self” showing or physical and exterior self, “Intestine & Self” showing the physical and internal, and lastly “Vivid & Self” showing our memories and imagination. With one of my words being “intestine” my lists and brain maps got graphic and dark very quickly,paired with the new concept of self, I landed on “Suicide”. </p><p>Once I arrived at a design opportunity, I began visual and factual research . Interestingly, the majority of the existing add campaigns, websites, and resources are geared toward young teenage girls. Even When I thought “suicide” I thought of that demographic first too. However, according to the American Foundation of Suicide Prevention 65% of suicides in the United States are committed by white males ages 45–59. I feel there is a design opportunity here and I choose to target my design toward these men.</p> <p>I believe there is a strong need for a message of awareness to this market mainly because the large numbers of suicide by adult males is a silent epidemic. I believe Bringing attention and awareness to this market will help change the discussion we have on suicide because it would focus on those who statistically need the help</p></div>'
